      <strong>Rock Paper Scissors</strong> is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The game has a long history and is often used as a selection method to make decisions or settle disputes.

      The game is simple: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. It is often used as a way to quickly resolve a disagreement or to determine a winner in a fair and random manner.
